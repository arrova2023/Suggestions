# Suggest Nearby Cities REST API

This REST API suggests nearby cities based on the name of the location, its latitude, and longitude.

## Usage

**REST API Consumption Validation URL**

**Type:** GET

https://springgcp-396905.nn.r.appspot.com/suggestions?q=london&lat=42.98339&lon=-81.23304

**URL Parameter Values**

- `q`: Location name (String)
- `lat`: Latitude (Float > 0)
- `lon`: Longitude (Float < 0)

**Response Format**

The response generated by the API consumption will have a format similar to the following:

```json
[
    {
        "name": "london : America/Toronto",
        "latitude": 42.98339,
        "longitude": -81.23304,
        "score": 1.0
    },
    {
        "name": "london : America/New_York",
        "latitude": 39.88645,
        "longitude": -83.44825,
        "score": 0.002552867223175697
    },
    {
        "name": "london : America/New_York",
        "latitude": 37.12898,
        "longitude": -84.08326,
        "score": 0.0014376255204344688
    }
]

```

Explanation

In each nesting of variables, we have the following variables:

name: Name of the location most closely related to the location entered by the user in the q variable in the URL.

latitude: Latitude

longitude: Longitude

score: The confidence level indicating whether the location entered by the user is correct or not.
This REST API is used to detect the closest locations with points of interest for a user and works as follows:

There is a database with names of locations and their respective latitude and longitude, containing thousands of points in Canada and the United States of America. While the service primarily focuses on North American users, the database can accommodate locations with points of interest worldwide. In the example provided, a user looking for a location called "london" at the coordinates 42.98339 latitude and -81.23304 longitude had a successful match with their query. Additionally, 2 more locations were found, but in different areas. The scores indicate that the relationship of the location name with the latitude and longitude entered by the user does not match other locations. This computational model automatically learns that the user's known location is in "Canada."

This was accomplished using an algorithm based on two feature extraction stages. The first stage employed the Cosine function, and the second stage utilized the SemiVersine function. The structure of the REST API is explained in detail below.

Feature Extraction
Taking into account the structure of the database named "cities_canada-usa.tsv," the first stage of feature extraction involves two techniques:

1. Cosine:
In this stage, the Cosine Similarity technique is used to analyze, search, and retrieve information. The user-entered location name (q) is compared with the names of all locations in the database (cities_canada-usa.tsv). If one or more locations with related names (similar or identical) are found, they are retrieved. Alongside, their respective latitude and longitude (lat and lon) are also recovered.

2. Semiversene:
In this stage, the Semiversene formula is used, which takes "the radius of the earth of 6371kms" as a frame of reference. It uses a function to automatically generate the degree of similarity/difference between the latitude and longitude entered by the user and the latitude and longitude of the locations retrieved in the previous stage (cosine).

**Suggests Application**:
Project main class:

**TermFrequencyCalculator**:
Before generating the Cosine Similarity between the city (q) and the cities of the database.tsv, the corresponding text strings must be transformed into vectors. This calculation cannot be performed on text strings, but it can be done if they are represented numerically.

**CosineSimilartyCalculator**:
Once the city names are represented as vectors, they can be compared by Cosine Similarity using this class. If cities related to the city entered by the user are found in the .tsv file, they are recovered and displayed.

**HaversineDistanceCalculator**:
After retrieving the related locations, the Haversine Distance is generated between the latitude and longitude entered by the user in the URL (value q) and the latitudes and longitudes of each retrieved location. The results are ordered in descending order, starting with the one with the greatest similarity and ending with the least similarity. A similarity of 1 (100%) means that the location is completely valid and can be trusted. A similarity closer to 0 indicates little probability of being related to the user's intentions and is not trusted to be the verified location.

**SuggestionsController:
This controller is used to load the data bank (cities_canada-usa.tsv). It first executes the Cosine calculation and then the Semiversene calculation.**

**cities_canada-usa.tsv:**
This is a data bank with location names, latitude, and longitude.
